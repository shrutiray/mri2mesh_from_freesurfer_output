This code helps to generate the tetrahedral brain images from the freesurfer recon -all output. Run these only after you have finished running freesurfer on the image files.

# mri2mesh_from_freesurfer_output
After downloading simnibs, substitute the mri2mesh file with the one from this github repository. Also download and add the mri2mesh.brain.source_surf.sh in the same directory path.
